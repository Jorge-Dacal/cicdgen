== CICDGEN

cicdgen is a devonfw tool for generate all code/files related to CICD. It's based on link:https://blog.angular.io/schematics-an-introduction-dc1dfbc2a2b2[angular schematics], so you can add it as a dependency into your project and generate the code using ng generate. In addition, it has its own CLI for those projects that are not angular based.
